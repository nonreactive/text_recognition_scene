# text_recognition_scene
Text recognition from a given scene using Supervised learning

This initial code has been taken from the git repository : 
https://github.com/FraPochetti/ImageTextRecognition
Its working blog by its author is present here:

We thank the creater of this code and we will only try to experiment and if possible, improve upon this code.
To make it working, you might need to install scikit's older version using this command:
pip install scikit-learn==0.15.2
Many other libraries would be needed to be installed prior to running this code. If possible, I will write them up here later.
